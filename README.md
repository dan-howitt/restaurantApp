# restaurantApp

This app is to enable customers to book tables at a restaurant and owners to manage their restaurants.
A new user can register as either an owner or a customer.
As a customer you can view the different restaurants that have been created and book a table against an available date/time.
As an owner you can view the restaurants that belong to you, you can create new restaurants and edit existing restaurants.  In addition you can view bookings made against each
restaurant.

All the data is stored into a SQL database.
There are 3 classes (Account, Restaurant, Booking) that provide the neccessary methods to interact with the application and the SQL database.
